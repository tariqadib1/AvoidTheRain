# AvoidTheRain
A simple game where the user controls a vertically fixed bar and avoids falling particles

Not the cleanest code, I'm afraid but its easily customizable.


Line 9: Set how long the player object is

Line 11: Set how large the falling particles are. The particles are circular-ish. So if you set a value where x=/=y you'll have oblong particles. 

Line 143: Increase difficult by increasing the value of the decrement. Basically the lower rainDropFrequency is, the more particles you have dropping in you

Line 145: Uncomment this one if you like flappy bird. Increase the increment if you really like to live dangerously

And thats about it. Give me a shout if you want to talk about this.
